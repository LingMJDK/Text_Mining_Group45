    "\n",
    "The aims of the assignment are:\n",
    "* Learn how to run a rule-based sentiment analysis module (VADER)\n",
    "* Learn how to run a machine learning sentiment analysis module (Scikit-Learn/ Naive Bayes)\n",
    "* Learn how to run scikit-learn metrics for the quantitative evaluation\n",
    "* Learn how to perform and interpret a quantitative evaluation of the outcomes of the tools (in terms of Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>)\n",
    "* Learn how to evaluate the results qualitatively (by examining the data) \n",
    "* Get insight into differences between the two applied methods\n",
    "* Get insight into the effects of using linguistic preprocessing\n",
    "* Be able to describe differences between the two methods in terms of their results\n",
    "* Get insight into issues when applying these methods across different  domains\n",

    "We recommend you go through the notebooks in the following order:\n",
    "* **Read the assignment (see below)**\n",
    "* **Lab3.2-Sentiment-analysis-with-VADER.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Lab3.3-Sentiment-analysis.with-scikit-learn.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Answer the questions of the assignment (see below) using the provided notebooks and submit**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you are asked to perform both quantitative evaluations and error analyses:\n",
    "* a quantitative evaluation concerns the scores (Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>) provided by scikit's classification_report. It includes the scores per category, as well as micro and macro averages. Discuss whether the scores are balanced or not between the different categories (positive, negative, neutral) and between precision and recall. Discuss the shortcomings (if any) of the classifier based on these scores\n",
    "* an error analysis regarding the misclassifications of the classifier. It involves going through the texts and trying to understand what has gone wrong. It servers to get insight in what could be done to improve the performance of the classifier. Do you observe patterns in misclassifications?  Discuss why these errors are made and propose ways to solve them."

    "The first three scores of the VADER output are ratios for the proportion of text that falls into the categories of 'negative', 'neutral' or 'positive'. Together they should add up to one. To rate the sentiment of these individual parts of text, VADER utilizes a valence based approach which means that not only the positive or negative sentiment of a word is assessed but also the intensity of the sentiment is taken into account. VADER retrieves these sentiment scores from a lexicon containing a vast amount of words including slang terms and punctuation. Additionally, VADER captures contextual nuances such as capitalization, where capital letters intensify sentiment, and everything that comes after the word 'but' influences the sentiment of the text that came before it. Finally a 'compound' score is calculated by adding up all the lexicon ratings and standardizing them to a rating between -1 and 1 which stand for extremely negative and extremely positive respectively. With that in mind we will analyze the scores of the sentences given above:"

    "    -SENTENCE 1: The positive sentiment for this sentence seems to be identified due to the word 'love,' which has a relatively high positive mean sentiment rating in the lexicon (3.2). No word in this sentence necessitates the use of negation or intensification rules.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -SENTENCE 2: The negative sentiment for this sentence is due to the use of \"don't\" before \"love\" which triggers negation handling, switching the sentiment to negative compared to the first sentence, resulting in a negative compound score (-0.5216). No word in this sentence necessitates the intensification rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -SENTENCE 3: The addition of ':-)', which has a positive mean sentiment rating in the lexicon of 1.3, increases the positive sentiment compared to the first sentence. This is reflected in a higher positive score (0.867) and compound score (0.7579). The increase in positive scores is attributable to VADER's capacity to recognize and assign sentiment values to emoticons, in addition to words. No word in this sentence necessitates the use of the negation or intensification rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -SENTENCE 4: The word \"ruins\" in this sentence is interpreted negatively in VADER's lexicon with a negative mean sentiment rating of -1.9, leading to a negative sentiment. While \"ruins\" can have a negative connotation, in this context, it might not necessarily be negative (e.g the houses reffered to in this sentence could be historic buildings). This highlights a limitation in VADER's ability to understand context. No word in this sentence necessitates the use of the negation or intensification rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -SENTENCE 5: The negation \"not\" applied to the concept of 'ruins' and the intensifier \"certainly\" are handled here, making the sentiment positive. Upon inspection, \"considered\" does not appear to add any sentiment value, likely because it is not associated with any specific sentiment score in VADER's lexicon. The result seems somewhat misleading when considering the neutral nature of the statement. VADER correctly inverts the sentiment due to negation but might be overestimating the positive score (0.49) leading to a more positive compound score(0.5867). This again seems to highlight a limitation in VADER's ability to understand context, similar to sentence 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -SENTENCE 6: This sentence seems to be incorrectly identified as negative with a compound score of (-0.4215), likely because of the word \"lies\", which has a negative mean sentiment rating of -1.8. This seems to underscore a limitation in VADER's ability to understand context, in particularly with polysemous words. 'Lies' is interpreted as dishonesty, whereas, in this context, it simply means reclining. This highlights a flaw in VADER's classification ability for sentences containing words with multiple meanings. No word in this sentence necessitates the use of the negation or intensification rules.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -SENTENCE 7: This sentence is identified with a positive sentiment, which may not entirely reflect the neutral nature of the comparison being made. The positive score (0.333) and compound score (0.3612) are unexpected, as the sentence appears neutral. This outcome may be attributed to the fact that 'like' is the only word from this sentence included in VADER's lexicon, carrying a positive mean sentiment rating of 1.5. This situation seems to highlight a limitation in VADER's ability to understand context, due to its limited lexicon. No word in this sentence necessitates the use of negation or intensification rules."

    "- The most relevant scores depend on the use case of a model. Here since neither the cost of false positive is high (precision) nor is it of utmost importance to capture as many true instances as possible (recall), the f1-score emerges as a particularly valuable metric. This is due to its balanced consideration of both precision and recall, offering a inclusive view of VADER's performance. Looking at the f1-scores across different sentiments can help identify which specific areas (positive, negative, neutral) might require improvements, such as adjusting the parameters of the 'run_vader' function to better capture neutral sentiments, in this case. The support metric indicates that hte sentiments seem to be fairly balanced, and since each sentiment category can be considered equally important, the macro avg for the f1-score is likely the single best metric to track in order to asses the performance of VADER in this experiment."

The use of \"really\" and \"less and less excited\" indicate intensification but in a negative context. VADER might misinterpret \"really\" as positive reinforcement to \"great work\" leading to a positive sentiment that overshadows negative indicators"

    "- yes, but not by much it would seem. The removal of stopwords with 'stop_words=stopwords.words('english')', and very common tokens (min_df), which are often not useful for training a classification model, means that the vocabulary is already focused on more meaningful words. Adjusting min_df primarily excludes less frequent terms, which may not add much predictive power beyond what the more frequent, informative tokens already provide. This suggests that key determinants of class membership are captured by the more frequent, informative tokens that remain after the threshold is applied."
