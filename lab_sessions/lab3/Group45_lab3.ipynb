    "This notebook describes the LAB-2 assignment of the Text Mining course. It is about sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of the assignment are:\n",
    "* Learn how to run a rule-based sentiment analysis module (VADER)\n",
    "* Learn how to run a machine learning sentiment analysis module (Scikit-Learn/ Naive Bayes)\n",
    "* Learn how to run scikit-learn metrics for the quantitative evaluation\n",
    "* Learn how to perform and interpret a quantitative evaluation of the outcomes of the tools (in terms of Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>)\n",
    "* Learn how to evaluate the results qualitatively (by examining the data) \n",
    "* Get insight into differences between the two applied methods\n",
    "* Get insight into the effects of using linguistic preprocessing\n",
    "* Be able to describe differences between the two methods in terms of their results\n",
    "* Get insight into issues when applying these methods across different  domains\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are going to create your own gold standard set from 50 tweets. You will the VADER and scikit-learn classifiers to these tweets and evaluate the results by using evaluation metrics and inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you go through the notebooks in the following order:\n",
    "* **Read the assignment (see below)**\n",
    "* **Lab3.2-Sentiment-analysis-with-VADER.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Lab3.3-Sentiment-analysis.with-scikit-learn.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Answer the questions of the assignment (see below) using the provided notebooks and submit**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you are asked to perform both quantitative evaluations and error analyses:\n",
    "* a quantitative evaluation concerns the scores (Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>) provided by scikit's classification_report. It includes the scores per category, as well as micro and macro averages. Discuss whether the scores are balanced or not between the different categories (positive, negative, neutral) and between precision and recall. Discuss the shortcomings (if any) of the classifier based on these scores\n",
    "* an error analysis regarding the misclassifications of the classifier. It involves going through the texts and trying to understand what has gone wrong. It servers to get insight in what could be done to improve the performance of the classifier. Do you observe patterns in misclassifications?  Discuss why these errors are made and propose ways to solve them."

    "### Exercise 1 Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1: The presence of the word \"love\" correctly influences a positive sententiment ('pos: 0.808', compound: '0.6369'). The word love has a high positive valence in the lexicon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 2: VADER implements the negatiion rule in this sentence, flipping the sentiment valence of 'love' to negative  (neg: 0.627, compound: -0.5216) . \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 3: The positive sentiment is even stronger (pos: 0.867, compound: 0.7579) than in sentence 1, correctly influenced by the emoticon \":-)\" which adds to the positive sentiment. Emoticons are included in VADER's lexicon. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 4: The negative sentiment (neg: 0.492, compound: -0.4404) comes from the word 'ruins' which can have negative connotations. This assignment might not always fit the context for example historical ruins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 5: The negation \"not\" correctly influences the sentiment to be more positive (pos: 0.49, compound: 0.5867), suggesting VADER's effective handling of negation in conjunction with an intensifier \"certainly\" leading to a high positive score. However with different context it could be the negative sentiment influence of 'ruins' could again make this sentence sentiment be inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 6: The negative sentiment (neg: 0.286, compound: -0.4215) is incorrectly applied. This is likely because \"lies\" is interpreted as dishonesty, whereas in this context, it simply means reclining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 7: The slightly positive sentiment (pos: 0.333, compound: 0.3612) might be unexpected as the sentence appears neutral. This could be due to the lack of contextually negative or positive cues, leading to a default slight positive interpretation. Without clear sentiment-laden words, the analysis leans slightly positive, which might reflect an inherent bias or the treatment of neutral statements in VADER's algorithm."

    "### Question 3 - part a (answer)\n",
    "Positive tweets have the lowest precision (0.308) but the highest recall (0.667), indicating the model often misclassifies tweets as positive but is good at catching most of the genuinely positive tweets. Neutral tweets exhibit higher precision (0.700) but lower recall (0.389), meaning while the model is relatively accurate when it predicts a tweet is neutral, it still misses many neutral tweets. For negative tweets, the precision is relatively low (0.500), indicating that only half of the tweets predicted as negative were correctly classified. The recall is even lower (0.350), suggesting the model misses a significant portion of truly negative tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Macro averages in this case are particularly relevant. They show VADERS performance across all sentiments, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses without bias toward more frequent categories. This balanced evaluation is essential for developing an unbiased understanding of public sentiment from social media data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, macro precision and recall are about 50% showing it both misclassifies about hafl of the tweets and only catches about half of the true positive tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3 - part b (answer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors for positive:\n",
    "For these tweets even though the gold label is positive, VADER calculated them all as negative sentiment. This is likely because with perspective matters in these tweets. While they do convey some negative sentiment the message is positive towards Rishi Sunak. VADER only looks for general sentiment and is not aware that the outcome of these tweets is one that is positive towards Sunak and just registers the negative sentiment towards something else. \n",
    "\n",
    "Errors for neutral: \n",
    "This is admittedly a difficult label to know manually as these neutral tweets generally give both positive and negatives to outcome neutral. Also once again VADER is unaware that while a tweet can contain one sentiment it is overall a different sentiment towards the subject (Rishi Sunak). For example: Tweet: I see a lot of white ass is getting burnt... #RishiSunak (Gold: neutral, VADER: negative). While this tweet without context is of negative sentiment since it also contains #RishiSunak its sentiment is more complex and is neutral since it is the meaning of the sentence does not refer to Sunak but a statement of the settings around him. \n",
    "\n",
    "Errors for negative:\n",
    "VADER incorrectly labels most of these tweets as postitive sentiment when in fact they are negative. This happens multiple times with the mention of wealth. While VADER may measure 'wealth' and 'full of money' with positive sentiment in Sunak's case as a politician it is meant with negative sentiment due to the idea that this means he is out of touch with the British Population. Additionally, in other tweets, the user addresses the audience ('Good morning') which has strong positive sentiment but then goes goes on to express negative sentiment about Sunak which doesnt have as strong effect on VADER's overall sentiment calculation.
