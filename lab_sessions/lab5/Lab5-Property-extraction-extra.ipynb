    "In the task of entity linking (see Lab4), we performed disambiguation of entity mentions in text by making a connection to the correct referrent for a mention in a knowledge base. Although these knowledge bases are typically fairly large, they are far from complete. Tasks like property extraction and relation extraction help to make knowledge bases more complete, by extracting knowledge from text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of property extraction aims to fill knowledge bases with information about properties of entities that we find in text. There are other tasks that are similar to it, such as: \n",
    "* slot filling, where we attempt to complete entity information according to some schema\n",
    "* relation extraction - given two entities, what is their relation (for example, in Microsoft X Bill_Gates, the relation X is `hasCEO`)\n",
    "* knowledge base completion, where we usually complete a knowledge base by inference from existing structured information (not from text).\n",
    "* open information extraction - no schema available, very little restrictions on what to extract, disambiguation is non-trivial\n",
    "\n",
    "In all these tasks, including property extraction, we typically extract \"pieces of knowledge\" in the form of **a triple**. A triple consists of three elements: a subject, a predicate, and an object (not to be confused with grammatical functions in a syntactic dependency structure). An example of a triple is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```[Barack_Obama hasAge 57]```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Barack_Obama is a subject, hasAge is a predicate/relation, and 57 is an object. In the Semantic Web, the subjects and the predicates of a triple are always URIs; the objects can be either a URI (like Barack_Obama), or a literal (like 57, or \"Barack\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, property extraction typically requires us to:\n",
    "1. **detect** a property value in text (e.g., 57) and an entity it belongs to (\"Barack\")\n",
    "2. **interpret** both the property value (57 as a number) and the entity (\"Barack\" means Barack_Obama)\n",
    "3. **find their relation** - the connection between Barack_Obama and 57 is the relation hasAge\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, the task of property extraction builds on top of the output of NERC and NERD.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges** The property extraction task is difficult for reasons similar to those we have discussed with entity linking: ambiguity (of entities, relations, and property values), variation (of entities, values, and relations), and vagueness (when insufficient details or information is given). Futhermore,  relations can sometimes span multiple sentences or require a lot of world knowledge in order to understand them."

    "#### 2.1 Methods\n",
    "Building automatic property extractors is not trivial, because it requires multiple steps, and these steps in practice might differ a lot across different properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common methods for extracting properties from text: pattern matching and distant supervision (supervised machine learning). \n",
    "* The most basic approach for extracting properties from text is by pattern matching. This approach is transparent, but it requires us to define the patterns for each of the properties separately. For example, for the property \"birthplace\", we can use the pattern: \"X, born in Y\", or \"X from Y\". Typically, the patterns are combined with information on entity types to help their precision. For example, we will check whether indeed X is a person and Y is indeed a location in the above example. We can also filter syntactic depedencies, e.g. X should be the syntactic subject of the predicate \"born in\".\n",
    "* The second approach, distant supervision, relies on knowledge base information that is loosely based on a text. For example, you can think of a Wikipedia document that describes Donald Trump on the one hand, and structured information from Wikidata that tells us that he is born in 1946. However, we don't know if this information is explicitly mentioned in the Wikipedia text and if so, where and how. With the distant supervision method, we train for example a recurrent neural network on top of this kind of output, and hope that the neural network will learn the patterns in which this properperty is typically given in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a pattern matching approach to build our extractors in this week's lab session. If you are curious about how to build a distant supervision extractor, you can check Snorkel (their [introductory notebooks](https://github.com/HazyResearch/snorkel/tree/master) are quite user-friendly).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Building a pattern-based extractor\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a pattern-based extractor consists of several parts:\n",
    "1. find a mention of a specific property (for example, money or birth date) in text\n",
    "2. assign this mention to some subject entity\n",
    "3. normalize the property value\n",
    "4. normalize the subject entity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example** Let's say we want to extract values for `founding year` in the following paragraph from Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Juventus F.C. is an Italian professional football club based in Turin. The club was founded in March 1897 by a group of Torinese students.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step I** First, we need to find property values that contain information about founding years. For example, we can use the pattern \"founded in\" to extract the property value `March 1897` in the second sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step II** Next, we need to see to which subject this property belongs. Assuming that we perform dependency parsing of the sentences, we can find that the relation \"founded in\" has a syntactic subject `The club`. At this point, we can extract the following relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The club FOUNDING_YEAR March 1897\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntactially this is the correct way to extract the relation. However, the relation is not really very useful yet - we need to normalize its subject and object somehow to make it useful in a semantic sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step III** Hence, we can normalize the value \"March 1897\" to a year value `1897`, for example, by looking for 4-digit numbers in the phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step IV** Then, we can normalize \"The club\" to `Juventus F.C.` by using entity coreference between the two sentences. We can then disambiguate the mention to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C., or `Juventus_F.C.` for brevity. This finally leads us to the following relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Juventus_F.C. FOUNDING_YEAR 1897`\n",
    "\n",
    "which looks much more useful (and it is on a semantic level, so we can store it in a knowledge base if we would like to)."

    "### 3. Coding pattern-based extractors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementing the four steps from 2.2** We will start by searching entity mentions of some type (e.g., nationality or date) by using SpaCy's named entity recognizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often this is not enough for step I, because an entity of a certain type can be a value of different properties. For example, the date \"1946\" can be a year of birth, a year of death, a founding year of a company, a year of starting/ending professional activity, etc. We will hence refer to this property value generation step as step Ia.\n",
    "\n",
    "In step Ib then, we can either:\n",
    "- check whether we find some keywords before the phrase (such as \"born in\" or \"founded in\"). We will build such an extractor in 3.1. \n",
    "- or use the dependency tree (also from SpaCy) to find the word that is associated with this value with a given dependency relation. We will do this in 3.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For step II of assigning the value to some entity phrase, we will look for the closest entity to this property value and assign it to that one. Step III would mostly differ per kind of property value - e.g., it is different to normalize dates than it is to normalize company names. We will not deal with step IV in this week's session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helper functions** We will use a number of helper functions in 3.1 and 3.2. These functions are located in the file `lab5_utils.py`. You don't need to know their functionality in detail (if you are curious, feel free to check their code). Let's load these helper functions first."
